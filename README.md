# Text Analysis Tool
A common desire for writers is to improve their craft at an advanced level. The service-oriented computing system I’ve developed provides them with an opportunity for growth. After logging in, users will be offered various services to analyze/summarize their input. For example, writing students can link one of their favorite blogs to my Top10ContentWords service, which analyzes the content and returns the most common words at that URL. Other services include retrieving the top 5 sentences, comparing text, and word count. Writers can even compare two of their favorite writers and analyze the common words they use. Across the services, the word filtering service can be used to remove repetitive or insignificant words. The point of these services is that the logical and literal brain of computing is being used to lead the user to insights that they wouldn’t have had on their own. This system is helpful to all kinds of writers, such as: bloggers, journalists, playwrights, songwriters, etc.
